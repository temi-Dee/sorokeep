## Why This Exists

Soroban's storage model is uncommon among major smart contract platforms: **state expires.** Every ledger entry — contract instances, persistent storage, WASM code — has a Time-To-Live (TTL). When it runs out, the entry is archived. If a contract's instance entry expires, the entire contract stops working. If persistent storage entries expire, user data becomes inaccessible until someone pays to restore it.

This is by design — state archival keeps Stellar lean and scalable. But it means **you must actively manage the lifecycle of your contract's state, or it dies.**

There is currently no dedicated open-source tool that combines TTL monitoring, alerting, auto-extension, cost tracking, and restoration for Soroban contracts. Developers either use manual CLI commands, build ad-hoc scripts, or embed TTL extension logic directly in their contracts.

Sorokeep is the unified operations layer that handles all of this.

> Security auditors have started flagging TTL mismanagement as a risk area in Soroban contracts. [Veridise](https://veridise.com/audits/soroban/) includes TTL handling in their audit scope. The [LayerZero Stellar endpoint audit](https://code4rena.com/audits/2026-04-layerzero-stellar-endpoint) explicitly lists TTL expiration edge cases as a concern. [OpenZeppelin's Stellar contracts library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/stellar-contracts) deliberately leaves instance storage TTL management to the application developer.

## Install

**Requirements:** Node.js 22+

```bash
# From source
git clone https://github.com/AbdulmalikAlayande/sorokeep.git
cd sorokeep
npm install
npm run build

# Run directly
npx tsx src/index.ts --help

# Or link globally after building
npm link
sorokeep --help

# Install the local man page
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/man/man1
cp man/sorokeep.1 ~/.local/share/man/man1/
mandb 2>/dev/null || true
man sorokeep
```

<!--
# npm (coming soon)
npm install -g sorokeep
-->

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Register a contract for monitoring
sorokeep watch CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC \
  --network testnet \
  --name "XLM Native Token"

# 2. Check its current TTL health
sorokeep status CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC

# 3. Set up a webhook alert (fires when TTL drops below 20,000 ledgers)
sorokeep alerts add \
  --contract CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC \
  --type webhook \
  --url https://your-server.com/webhook \
  --threshold 20000

# 4. Start the monitoring daemon
sorokeep daemon --network testnet
```

The daemon will check TTLs every 5 minutes, fire alerts when thresholds are crossed, send resolution notifications when TTLs recover, and auto-extend entries if guard policies are configured.

## Commands

### `sorokeep watch <contract-id>`

Register a contract for monitoring. Connects to the Stellar RPC, discovers the contract's instance and WASM code entries, reads their TTLs, and stores everything locally.

```bash
sorokeep watch <contract-id> [options]
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-n, --name <name>` | Human-readable contract name | — |
| `--network <network>` | `testnet` or `mainnet` | `testnet` |
| `-r, --rpc-url <url>` | Custom Stellar RPC endpoint | Network default |
| `--storage-keys <keys>` | Comma-separated base64 XDR storage keys to track | — |

**Example output:**

```
$ sorokeep watch CDLZFC3S...CYSC --network testnet --name "XLM Native Token"

✔ Contract XLM Native Token registered successfully.

  Contract: XLM Native Token (CDLZFC3S...CYSC)
  Network:  testnet
  Entries:  1 discovered
  Instance TTL: 113,918 ledgers (~7d 6h)  OK

  Run 'sorokeep status CDLZFC3S...CYSC' to check TTLs anytime.
  Run 'sorokeep guard CDLZFC3S...CYSC' to enable auto-extension.
```

Entry discovery happens in layers:

1. **Deterministic** (automatic) — Contract instance and WASM code entries, derived from the contract ID and WASM hash. Always tracked.
2. **Footprint-based** (daemon) — Discovered by scanning on-chain transaction events for storage keys your contract uses.
3. **Manual** (opt-in) — Specific storage keys declared via `--storage-keys`.

---

### `sorokeep status <contract-id>`

Display current TTL health for a watched contract. Reads from the local database — no RPC call.

```bash
sorokeep status <contract-id>
```

Shows contract name, network, last checked ledger, and a table of all tracked entries with remaining TTL in ledgers and human-readable time, plus a status indicator (OK / Warning / Critical).

---

### `sorokeep daemon`

Start the long-running monitoring process.

```bash
sorokeep daemon [options]
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--network <network>` | Network to monitor | `testnet` |
| `--interval <ms>` | Polling interval in milliseconds (min: 10,000) | `300000` (5 min) |
| `-r, --rpc-url <url>` | Custom RPC endpoint | Network default |

Each cycle performs three phases:

1. **Monitor** — Fetches fresh TTLs for all contracts, detects threshold crossings, resolves recovered alerts
2. **Deliver** — Dispatches pending alerts to configured webhook and Slack channels
3. **Auto-Extend** — Extends TTLs for contracts with active guard policies

The daemon handles graceful shutdown on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` and includes a re-entrance guard to prevent overlapping cycles.

---

### `sorokeep alerts`

Manage alert configurations. Supports five subcommands.

#### `alerts add` — Create a new alert

```bash
sorokeep alerts add [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--contract <id>` | Contract ID to alert on (required) |
| `--type <type>` | `webhook` or `slack` (required) |
| `--url <url>` | Webhook POST URL (required for webhook) |
| `--channel <channel>` | Slack channel name or ID (required for slack) |
| `--threshold <ledgers>` | Fire when remaining TTL drops below this (required) |
| `--secret <secret>` | HMAC signing secret for webhooks (auto-generated if omitted) |

For webhook alerts, an HMAC signing secret is auto-generated (32-byte hex) if you don't provide one. The secret is displayed once at creation time — save it to verify webhook signatures on your server. See [Webhook Signing](#webhook-signing) for details.

#### `alerts list` — View configured alerts

```bash
sorokeep alerts list --contract <id>
```

#### `alerts remove` — Delete an alert configuration

```bash
sorokeep alerts remove --id <config-id>
```

#### `alerts test` — Send a test alert

```bash
sorokeep alerts test --id <config-id>
```

Fires a synthetic `threshold_crossed` event through the real delivery pipeline. Useful for verifying that your webhook endpoint or Slack channel is correctly configured before going live.

#### `alerts history` — View past alert activity

```bash
sorokeep alerts history --contract <id> [--limit 20]
```

Shows a table of fired alerts: timestamp, entry label, TTL at fire, channel type, delivery status, retry count, and resolution time.

---

### `sorokeep guard`

Configure auto-extension policies. When enabled, the daemon automatically extends TTLs by submitting `ExtendFootprintTTLOp` transactions using a funded Stellar keypair.

```bash
sorokeep guard <contract-id> [options]
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--target-ttl <ledgers>` | TTL to extend entries to | `100000` |
| `--threshold <ledgers>` | Extend when TTL drops below this | `20000` |
| `--keypair <secret>` | Stellar secret key (for one-time extension) | — |
| `--keypair-env <var>` | Env var name containing the secret key | — |
| `--auto-extend` | Enable daemon auto-extension (requires `--keypair-env`) | — |
| `--dry-run` | Simulate extension and show estimated fee | — |
| `--disable` | Disable auto-extension for this contract | — |

**Usage modes:**

```bash
# Check current policy
sorokeep guard <contract-id>

# Dry run — see estimated fee without submitting
sorokeep guard <contract-id> --keypair S... --dry-run

# One-time immediate extension
sorokeep guard <contract-id> --keypair S...

# Enable auto-extension for the daemon
sorokeep guard <contract-id> --keypair-env STELLAR_SECRET_KEY --auto-extend

# Disable auto-extension
sorokeep guard <contract-id> --disable
```

**Security:** Secret keys are never stored in the database. When using `--auto-extend`, only the public key and the environment variable name are persisted. The daemon resolves the actual secret key from the environment at runtime.

---

### `sorokeep costs`

View extension history and rent spending for a contract.

```bash
sorokeep costs <contract-id> [options]
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--period <days>` | Show costs for the last N days | `30` |
| `--all` | Show all history | — |

**Output includes:**

- Total extensions and total cost in XLM
- Breakdown by entry type (instance, wasm, persistent) with count and cost
- 30-day cost projection extrapolated from the selected period
- Recent extensions table: timestamp, entry label, old TTL → new TTL, cost in XLM, transaction hash

---

### `sorokeep restore`

Recover archived ledger entries via `RestoreFootprintOp` transactions.

```bash
sorokeep restore <contract-id> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--keypair <secret>` | Stellar secret key |
| `--keypair-env <var>` | Env var containing secret key |
| `--entry <keyXdr>` | Specific entry key XDR to restore (repeatable) |
| `--all` | Restore all tracked entries for the contract |

One of `--keypair` or `--keypair-env` is required. One of `--entry` or `--all` is required (mutually exclusive).

```bash
# Restore a specific entry
sorokeep restore <contract-id> --keypair-env STELLAR_SECRET_KEY --entry <base64-xdr>

# Restore all tracked entries
sorokeep restore <contract-id> --keypair-env STELLAR_SECRET_KEY --all
```

---

### `sorokeep resources`

View resource usage logs (CPU instructions, memory bytes, fee structures) for a contract to track execution efficiency over time.

---

### `sorokeep budget`

Set and monitor a monthly XLM extension budget for a contract. Prevents runaway costs if a contract requires frequent extensions.

---

### `sorokeep channels`

Manage funded channel accounts used to submit extension and restoration transactions concurrently, avoiding sequence number bottlenecks.

---

### `sorokeep inspect`

Inspect on-chain state directly. Can parse Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) token balances, diff state changes, and decode XDR without manual intervention.

---

### `sorokeep check`

Perform an ad-hoc, one-off execution of the monitoring cycle without starting the long-running daemon.

---

### `sorokeep db`

Database management tasks, including migrations, backups, and introspection cache management.

---

### `sorokeep completion`

Generate shell autocomplete scripts for bash/zsh to enable tab completion for all Sorokeep commands.

## Alerting

Sorokeep delivers alerts through multiple channels: **webhooks**, **Slack**, **Discord**, **Telegram**, and **PagerDuty**. Each alert includes a severity level and rich context about the affected entry. Sorokeep uses a robust, decoupled detection and dispatch architecture with a database-backed queue.

### Alert Lifecycle

1. **Threshold Crossed** — During each monitoring cycle, if an entry's remaining TTL drops below a configured threshold, the monitor writes a `threshold_crossed` alert to the database queue.
2. **Delivery** — The dispatcher reads undelivered rows from the queue and routes the alert to the configured channel. Failed deliveries are retried on subsequent cycles, up to 5 attempts, and then gracefully abandoned. Success marks the row as delivered.
3. **Resolution** — When TTL recovers past the threshold (e.g., after an extension), Sorokeep fires an `alert_resolved` notification to all configured channels.

### Severity Levels

Severity is computed automatically based on how much TTL remains relative to the configured threshold:

| Severity | Condition | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **critical** | Remaining TTL < 25% of threshold, or TTL = 0 | Entry is in immediate danger of archival |
| **warning** | Remaining TTL is below threshold but above 25% | Entry needs attention soon |
| **info** | Alert resolved (TTL recovered) | Entry is healthy again |

### Webhook Delivery

Webhook alerts are delivered as HTTP POST requests with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "type": "threshold_crossed",
  "severity": "warning",
  "contractId": "CDLZFC3S...",
  "contractName": "XLM Native Token",
  "network": "testnet",
  "entry": {
    "keyXdr": "AAAA1234...",
    "type": "instance",
    "label": "Contract Instance"
  },
  "threshold": {
    "configuredLedgers": 20000,
    "currentRemainingLedgers": 8500,
    "approximateTimeRemaining": "~13h 0m"
  },
  "firedAtLedger": 2500000,
  "timestamp": "2026-06-13T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Webhook Signing

Webhook requests include an HMAC-SHA256 signature in the `X-Sorokeep-Signature` header for payload verification:

```
X-Sorokeep-Signature: sha256=a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

To verify on your server:

```javascript
import { createHmac } from "node:crypto";

function verifySignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expected = "sha256=" + createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest("hex");
  return signature === expected;
}
```

The signing secret is auto-generated when you create a webhook alert (or you can provide your own with `--secret`). It is displayed once at creation time — store it securely.

### Slack Delivery

Slack alerts are sent via the [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) using Block Kit for rich formatting. Messages include severity icons, contract details, remaining TTL, and actionable hints.

**Setup:**

1. Create a Slack app with `chat:write` scope at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Install the app to your workspace and copy the Bot User OAuth Token (`xoxb-...`)
3. Provide the token via environment variable:

```bash
export SOROKEEP_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
```

Alternatively, store the token in your config file at `~/.sorokeep/config.yaml`:

```yaml
slackToken: "xoxb-your-bot-token"
```

The environment variable takes precedence over the config file.

### Retry Policy

Failed alert deliveries are automatically retried on subsequent daemon cycles. After **5 consecutive failures**, the alert is abandoned and no further delivery attempts are made. You can view delivery status and retry counts with `sorokeep alerts history`.

## How It Works

Sorokeep is an off-chain monitoring tool. It reads data from the Stellar RPC, stores it locally in SQLite, and acts on it (alerts, auto-extension, restoration). It does not run on-chain and does not require you to modify your contracts.

```

### The Daemon Cycle

Every polling interval (default: 5 minutes), the daemon runs three phases:

1. **Monitor** — For each registered contract, fetches fresh TTLs from the RPC, updates the database, checks each entry against every configured alert threshold. Fires `threshold_crossed` when TTL drops below a threshold; fires `alert_resolved` when TTL recovers.

2. **Deliver** — Processes all undelivered alerts from the database queue. Routes each to its configured channel (Webhook, Slack, Discord, Telegram, PagerDuty), marks successful deliveries, increments retry counters on failures, and abandons gracefully after 5 retries.

3. **Auto-Extend** — For contracts with an active guard policy, checks which entries have TTL below the policy threshold and simulates an `ExtendFootprintTTLOp` transaction via the Stellar RPC. If successful, it submits the transaction, records the exact XLM cost, and updates the contract's monthly budget usage to prevent runaway spend.

For the full data-flow (exact call order, fault isolation between phases, where a new contribution typically lands), see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Storage

All state is local. Sorokeep stores data in `~/.sorokeep/sorokeep.db` (SQLite with WAL mode). No external services required beyond a Stellar RPC endpoint.

**Database tables:**

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `contracts` | Registered contracts with network, name, WASM hash |
| `contract_entries` | Tracked ledger entries with TTLs and discovery source |
| `extension_policies` | Auto-extension rules per contract (threshold, target, keypair reference) |
| `alert_configs` | Alert channels, thresholds, and webhook secrets |
| `alerts_fired` | Fired alert records with delivery status, retry count, and resolution tracking |
| `extension_history` | Every TTL extension with transaction hash and XLM cost |

### Configuration

Sorokeep stores user configuration in `~/.sorokeep/config.yaml`:

```yaml
network: testnet
pollingIntervalSeconds: 300
slackToken: "xoxb-..."        # Optional — can also use SOROKEEP_SLACK_TOKEN env var
rpcUrl: "https://..."         # Optional — overrides network default
```

The config file is created with `0600` permissions (owner read/write only) to protect sensitive values like the Slack token.

**Architecture layers:**

- **Commands** (`src/commands/`) — Thin CLI layer. Parses arguments, calls core, formats terminal output. No business logic.
- **Core** (`src/core/`) — Pure business logic. Testable without network or CLI. The daemon reuses the same functions.
- **RPC** (`src/rpc/`) — Stellar SDK wrapper. All network calls go through here. Handles transaction building, simulation, signing, and submission.
- **Alerts** (`src/alerts/`) — Delivery pipeline. Channel-specific formatting and transport, routing, retry management.
- **DB** (`src/db/`) — SQLite repositories. All queries centralized here. In-memory mode for tests.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run tests/core/monitor.test.ts

# Watch mode
npx vitest
```

**891 tests** across **66 test files** covering:

- **Formatting** — TTL conversion, status classification, human-readable time
- **Database** — CRUD, cascades, upserts, deduplication, alert delivery queues
- **RPC Client** — Contract instance, WASM code, batch TTL queries, transaction simulation
- **Watch** — Registration, re-watch, SAC contracts, error handling, network isolation, introspection
- **Monitor Cycle** — TTL refresh, threshold detection, alert deduplication, resolution, fault isolation, multi-threshold escalation, partial RPC responses
- **Extension** — TTL extension, auto-extension policy evaluation, restore, cost recording, budget enforcement
- **Alert Dispatcher** — Channel routing, retry logic, max retry cap, abandoned alerts (Slack, Discord, Telegram, Webhook, PagerDuty)
- **Webhook** — HMAC-SHA256 signing, timeout handling, HTTP error responses
- **Slack** — Token resolution, Block Kit structure, `body.ok` validation
- **CLI Commands** — Alerts, budget, guard, costs, watch, status, daemon, check, restore, db, channels
- **Config** — Load/save, defaults, parse failure handling, file permissions
- **Daemon** — Start/stop, re-entrance guard, cycle error isolation
- **MCP Server** — Test coverage for all exposed MCP tools

All tests use in-memory SQLite databases and mocked RPC responses — no network calls, no filesystem side effects. TDD is practiced throughout.

## FAQ

### Why TypeScript, not Rust?

Sorokeep is an off-chain operational tool, not a smart contract. TypeScript was chosen because:

1. The Stellar JS SDK is the most complete client library for Soroban RPC interactions
2. Soroban developers already have Node.js in their toolchain
3. npm distribution means zero-friction installation
4. The performance requirements (periodic RPC polling) are well within Node.js capabilities
5. It maximizes the contributor pool — most Soroban developers know TypeScript

### Is my secret key stored anywhere?

No. When you configure auto-extension with `--keypair-env`, Sorokeep stores only the **public key** and the **environment variable name** in the database. The actual secret key is resolved from your environment at runtime. If you use `--keypair` for a one-time operation, the key is used in-memory and never persisted.

### What happens if the daemon crashes mid-cycle?

Each phase (monitor, deliver, auto-extend) is wrapped in isolated error handling. A failure in one phase doesn't prevent the others from running. Alert deliveries are idempotent — if a delivery was marked successful, it won't be re-sent. If the daemon restarts, undelivered alerts will be picked up on the next cycle.

### What networks are supported?

Testnet (`https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`) and Mainnet (`https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com`). You can also point Sorokeep at any custom RPC endpoint with `--rpc-url`.

### What about email alerts?

Email is not yet implemented. The CLI will reject `--type email` with a clear error message. Webhook and Slack are the supported channels today.

## Roadmap

- Plugin interface for alert channels — so a new channel (Matrix, MS Teams, email) doesn't require touching core dispatch code or the DB schema
- Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint for teams with existing observability stacks
- Reusable GitHub Action wrapping `sorokeep check` for CI-integrated TTL checks
- Web dashboard for visual TTL monitoring
- Multi-contract batch operations
